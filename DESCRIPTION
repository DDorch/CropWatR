Description: Functions to enable calculation of FAO Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration, crop- and soil-water balances for agricultural crops. GIS-enabled implementation (using R's basic spatial packages, including rgeos, rgdal sp, raster) at a daily time-step, including calibration methods for irrigation scheduling and variable crop planting and harvesting dates. Crop-water models according to the FAO 56 document 'Crop evapotranspiration - Guidelines for computing crop water requirements'
